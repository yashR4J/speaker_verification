"""
Gathers and creates data manifest files from user interface.
For speaker-id, different sentences of the same speaker must appear in train,
validation, and test sets. In this case, these sets are thus derived from
splitting the original training set intothree chunks.

    Prepares the json files for the User dataset.

    Arguments
    ---------
    data_folder : str
        Path to the folder where the user dataset is stored.
    save_json_train : str
        Path where the train data specification file will be saved.
    save_json_valid : str
        Path where the validation data specification file will be saved.
    save_json_test : str
        Path where the test data specification file will be saved.
    split_ratio: list
        List composed of three integers that sets split ratios for train, valid,
        and test sets, respectively. For instance split_ratio=[80, 10, 10] will
        assign 80% of the sentences to training, 10% for validation, and 10%
        for test.

    Example
    -------
    >>> data_folder = '/path/to/mini_librispeech'
    >>> prepare_mini_librispeech(data_folder, 'train.json', 'valid.json', 'test.json')
