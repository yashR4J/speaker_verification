    "Automated speaker verification (ASV), in the modern day, is omnipresent in smart devices and in services offered by call centres. It serves as a biometric means of authenticating a claimed identity by analysing a spoken sample of their voice. \n",
    "our team sought to extend our understanding of neural style transfer by exploring how convolutional neural networks could be used to harness the ability to speak in the voice of another person."
