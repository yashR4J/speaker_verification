    "What if you could sing in your favorite musician's voice? Or if your favourite musician would sing a song in your voice? Inspired by the AI-powered instrument built by [Holly Herndon](https://www.ted.com/talks/holly_herndon_what_if_you_could_sing_in_your_favorite_musician_s_voice?language=en), our team sought to extend our understanding of neural style transfer by exploring how convolutional neural networks could be used to harness the ability to speak in the voice of another person."
